# fancytables

A modern port of the python prettytables package for creating nice tables with text characters.

This project uses prettytables as its basis and retains that package as a subset. I.E.: This package is a superset of prettytables.

fancytables is only aiming at compatibility of Python 3.* , all 2.* users can use the prettytables subset which is fully compatible with those versions.

Any contributions are welcome!
