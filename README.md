# fancytables

A modern port of the python prettytable package for creating nice tables with text characters.

This project uses prettytable as its basis and retains that package as a subset. I.E.: This package is a superset of prettytable.

fancytables is only aiming at compatibility of Python 3.* , all 2.* users can use the prettytable subset which is fully compatible with those versions.

Any contributions are welcome!

Planned features:

- Intuitive and robust API: Improve on the API of prettytable but keep the good parts. This might include easy&quick vs. custom&complex API splits, not so sure yet.
- Unicode support: One of the key objectives is to make good-looking tables with Unicode box drawing characters without much effort of the end user.
- Highly customizable: This will most notably include the possibility of user-defined table styles and formatting.
- CLI for shell script integration and quick usage.
